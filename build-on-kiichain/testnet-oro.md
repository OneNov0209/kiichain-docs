# Testnet Oro

KiiChain is a peer-to-peer decentralized EVM-compatible network built with the Cosmos SDK. The public testnet is called KiiChain Testnet Oro.

Testnet Oro is the permanent testnet with smart contract functionality and EVM compatibility. All Hackathons, Builds, Airdrops, and test deployments should be done on this network.

## Source code

The source code for the Testnet Oro can be found at:

* [Kiichain](https://github.com/KiiChain/kiichain)

## **EVM / CW Addresses**

KiiChain Testnet Oro features a mirrored EVM - CW smart contract module that replicates EVM compatibility. CW addresses are structured in Bech32 format with a distinctive "kii" prefix, characteristic of Cosmos-based chains. EVM addresses are structured with the hexadecimal format akin to Ethereum addresses. This alteration reflects a strategic adaptation to streamline interoperability with Ethereum-based tools and infrastructure, facilitating a seamless transition for developers and users alike.

```
// CosmWasm based addresses
kii123abc...

// EVM based addresses
0x123abc...
```

## **Tokens**

KII serves as the primary utility token within the KiiChain ecosystem, facilitating transactions and powering network operations, notably through the payment of gas fees. Distinguished by its fungibility and interoperability, KII can be seamlessly transferred and utilized across various wallet providers, including popular EVM rpc-based options like MetaMask & Coinbase wallet and cosmos-based wallets like Keplr and Leap. By leveraging KII, users can engage in a diverse array of interactions within the KiiChain network, ranging from simple transactions to more complex smart contract executions, thereby driving the adoption and utility of the native token within the broader blockchain landscape.
